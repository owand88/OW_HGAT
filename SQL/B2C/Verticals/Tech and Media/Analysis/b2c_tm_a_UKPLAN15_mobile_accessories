/*
Task: Kumaran is trying to understand if there is any concentration of GMB (either seller, EPID or listing level) in mobile phone accessories and specifically in the following L3s:

Cases, Covers and Skins (20349)
Chargers & Docks (123417)
Cables 
 
"Could you please help me understand these two categories better. Like I said, any concentration of GMB (note GMB not GMV) in this category across sellers, EPIDs, listings (or other views you think are interesting) would be helpful."

Objective:  It’s a category that’s decline a while and question is whether we can impact it by working with a handful of sellers / on a few products.
