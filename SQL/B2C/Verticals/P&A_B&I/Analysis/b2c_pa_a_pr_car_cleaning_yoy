-- REQUESTED BY ANNIE SHIELD
--FOR PR DATA

-- I have another PR P&A data ask it would be great to please get your support on. We’re looking for some sales info on car cleaning products to support a Detailing Masterclass event. Please could take a look at the ask below and advise when we could get this back? Hoping for the 7th of August if at all possible:

 
-- •	2022 and 2023 sales data for car cleaning products with monthly breakdown. 
-- •	From this we’re hoping to extrapolate:
-- •	The YOY% change in sales across different cleaning products
-- •	The best selling car cleaning products this year vs last year 
-- •	The top month for sales of car cleaning products based on 2022 data
