--Currently manual process involving Tashy sending Elle a list of listing ID >> Elle creates URLs like https://www.ebay.co.uk/e/home-garden/home-outlet-swoon >> adding listings to events
--Not all events on the HO hub will be tracked by my report, there are flash sales events on the page which change bi-weekly (e.g. https://www.ebay.co.uk/e/home-garden/up-to-50-off-swoon-and-cox-cox) << no "home outlet" embedded in the url. These events show up on Tableau reporting so won't need to be accounted for in my report
--If listing is out of stock, it remains in the event until event ends. There is no tag to the listing that allows Elle/Tashy to take listings off events effortlessly
