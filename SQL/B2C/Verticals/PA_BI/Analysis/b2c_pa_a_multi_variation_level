-- Oils, fluids and  lubricants category has many listings which are listed as multi-variation. I am keen to understand which variation did most sales so we can plan volume based promotion activities with sellers i.e Get 10% off all 1L  castrol oils

-- In addition to this, castrol_official_store is keen to understand which volume variation listing is driving more sales for them so they can allocate stock for them accordingly next year.

-- Example listing: 384817647975

-- Category: oils, fluids & lubricants  with id: 179487
-- From 24th oct, the category will be renamed to below:

-- Oils, Fluids, Lubricants & Sealers
