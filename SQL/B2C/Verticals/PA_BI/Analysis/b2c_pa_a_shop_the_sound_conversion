--Shop The Sound conversion analysis

 
-- I wanted to do a conversion analysis of the listings of the seller who is in the Shop The Sound featured promotion. I have attached a copy of the listings that they have sound feature on.
-- The seller is grmoto_exhausts (869341213)


-- Comparatively and as discussed, here is an equivalent seller representing similar inventory type criteria and seller size in the particular category;
-- Blackwidowexhausts (264507931). 


-- Also, just for a recap, the event launched in week 35 (29th of August) and the category in question is the L4 Silencers, Mufflers & Baffles [178000]
