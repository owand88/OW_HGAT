-- I am working on some data that will need to be presented to Jesse surrounding the motorcycle category, and I was hoping you could help.
-- Would you by any chance be able to pull the top 3 declining sellers in these 5 categories:

-- 1.	Other Motorcycle & Scooter Parts & Accessories (179753)
-- 2.	Exhaust & Emission Systems (180027)
-- 3.	Electrical & Ignition Components (179853)
-- 4.	Motorcycle & Motorsports Gear (261272)
-- 5.	Helmets & Accessories (177075)
(179753,180027,179853,261272,177075)
